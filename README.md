# Resume Classification System

A machine learning-powered Streamlit application that automatically classifies resumes into three categories: **AI**, **Web**, or **Data**.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze resume content and categorize them based on the skills and experience mentioned. The classification is performed using TF-IDF vectorization combined with a Logistic Regression classifier, achieving 84.44% accuracy.

### Categories
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks
- **Web**: Web Development, Frontend, Backend, Full Stack Development
- **Data**: Data Science, Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Business Intelligence

## 🎯 Features

- **Multiple Input Methods**
  - Paste resume text directly
  - Upload text files (.txt)
  - Test with sample resumes
  
- **Classification Details**
  - Category prediction
  - Confidence score
  - Probability distribution across all categories
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Clean, intuitive Streamlit web application
  - Real-time classification
  - Visual confidence indicators
  - Color-coded results

## 📊 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with bigrams
- **Accuracy**: 84.44% on test set
- **Framework**: scikit-learn
- **Language**: Python
- **Confidence Scores**: Supported via predict_proba

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd resume_classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   This will create a `models/resume_classifier.pkl` file containing the trained model.

5. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔧 Development

### Training a Custom Model

To retrain the model with your own data, modify the `training_data` dictionary in `train_model.py`:

```python
training_data = {
    'AI': [list of AI resumes/descriptions],
    'Web': [list of Web resumes/descriptions],
    'Data': [list of Data resumes/descriptions]
}
```

Then run:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- **streamlit**: Web application framework for machine learning apps
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for classification
- **numpy**: Numerical computing library
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Resume text is cleaned and tokenized
2. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorizer (with unigrams and bigrams) converts text into 3000 numerical features
3. **Classification**: Logistic Regression classifier predicts the category with probability estimates
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Probability scores are calculated for each category using predict_proba
5. **Pipeline**: Text vectorization and classification happen in a single scikit-learn Pipeline

## 📈 Model Performance

**Overall Accuracy**: 84.44%

| Category | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| AI       | 100%      | 73%    | 85%      |
